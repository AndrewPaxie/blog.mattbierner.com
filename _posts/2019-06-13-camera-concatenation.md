Recently I wanted to take a self-portrait. So I got out a camera and composed everything up all nice. Perfect!

Although, on second thought, rather conventional. So I took a phone and aimed it at the camera's screen, making sure it was focused on the LCD good and proper.

Next, to really ensure that any faces in the photo would be detected correctly, I took another phone and pointed it at the first phone's screen. And, for a bit of vintage flair, I next dusted off a iPhone X/2, and threw it into the series.

Then, to counteract the low resolution of this last element, I took an iPad and aimed it at the screen of the last phone. Such large format photography was really quite an improvement.

Finally, I connected a webcam to a laptop and aimed it at the iPad. This way I could use a screen capture to record my photo digitally. And now you're seeing the digital captures.

<!-- And of course the real last step of any camera concatenation is to embed the captured screenshot into a word document, print it out, and take a photo the print laying on a clean, wooden table. -->
