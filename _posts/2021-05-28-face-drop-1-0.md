You may remember Face Drop from some [proof of concept videos](/face-drop) I shared a few weeks back. People seemed to like the idea, so I spent the past few weeks polishing the app into a shippable state.

I've also made a few notable improvements since the original demo:

- Support for all iOS devices.

    Face Drop now runs on all iOS devices. If your device does not have a TrueDepth camera, you can capture 2D selfies and place them in the world (users with a TrueDepth can also switch between 2D and 3D capture modes)

- Pin mode.

    This lets you stick copies of your face to real world surfaces. Hold down the shutter button to spraypaint your face onto the surface.
    
    As with the physics, this feature requires a device with a LiDAR sensor.

- Improved UI.


The app is still pretty basic, so I'm hoping to add features like being able to save and switch between snapshots sometime soon.

So [give Face Drop a try][app] and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions. Also be sure to share anything fun you create using the app.
