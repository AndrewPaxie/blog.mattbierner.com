[*A Page Out Of My Book*][site] lets you create personalized, framed wall art featuring an original illustration and quote of your choice from classic books. I read and listen to a lot of public domain books but rarely own physical copies anymore, ever of my favorites. A friend and I created *A Page Out Of My Book* so that we'd have a way to remember and showcase the books and quotes that moved us.

Use [the site][site] to pick out an illustration and interactively design your wall art. Although we recommend using a quote from the book, you can really use whatever text you like (even emojis or an ascii penis if that's your thing).

The art is all made to order and uses high quality frames with matting. The frames are 8 inches wide and 10 inches tall. They ship fully assembled too; all you need to do is stick it on your wall. Besides framed physical prints, you can also order a high resolution digital file of the design that you can print yourself.

Checkout [the site][site] if you also enjoy classic books and are interested creating some of your own wall art for them. We also have been posting some of our favorite illustrations and quotes [over on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/APageOutOfMyBook).
