*American Heat* is a 5x7 inch letterpress card printed in four passes on a Vandercook SP15 at Seattle's [School of Visual Concepts](https://www.svcseattle.com). The "Heat" text was a linoleum [reduction cut](http://www.boardingallrows.com/linoleum-reduction-prints), and my first real attempt at linoleum carving.

The design is derived from a movie poster for the film *Arctic Heat* (also known as *Born American*). As is often the case, the movie cannot live up to its poster despite staring Mike Norris, son of Chuck Norrisâ€”although the movie's slogan is surprisingly relevant. The letterpress print has less vibrant and clean look than the poster.
