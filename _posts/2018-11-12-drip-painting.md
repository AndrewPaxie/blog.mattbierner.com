Although vulgarly disparaged as something that "my kid could paint", drip painting continues to profoundly challenge our conception of art and artist. In surrendering to the uncontrollableness of the drip, the painter becomes a conduit through which the unconscious mind flows onto the canvas. The seemingly disordered process of creation and the superficial chaos of the resulting works belie an extremely cerebral form of expression that forces us to contemplate the role of conscious intentionality not only in the act of creation but also in our processing of the art itself.

This video profiles a drip painter at work.
