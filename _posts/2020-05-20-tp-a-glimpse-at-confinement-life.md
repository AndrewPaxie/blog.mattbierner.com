*TP: A Glimpse at Confinement Life* is a short film I made for the [Confinement Film Festival](https://coff.tv).

Unfortunately it didn't make the cut, leaving me feeling somewhat silly for having made a film involving intimate relations with a roll of toilet paper. Oh well, at least it provided a good way to pass a Saturday.
