Beatsy is an augmented reality music visualizer for iOS that uses your music or voice to modify the world around you. Turn your wall into a giant speaker or transform a road into a rolling wave of notes. Get it for free [in the App Store][app].

Beatsy currently features two built-in visualizers: one that vibrates a surface like a giant speaker and one that shows notes over time. You can adjust some parameters of these visualizers, such as their amplitude (how much they distort the surface). I plan on adding more visualizers in the future.

Other highlights:

- Scale the visualizers up to massive sizes.

- Take screenshots and record videos of the visualizers in action.

- Adjust lighting on visualizers so that they blend well into the world.

If you enjoy Beatsy, be sure to tell your friends and share any cool visualizations you create!

## Background

I've long wanted to use music to modify my reality, but couldn't ever figure out how to do this in a convincing way. Earlier this year though, I figured out that I could [use ARKit to distort real world surfaces](/reality-shaders) with surprisingly convincing results. This eventually evolved into [*In The Walls*][walls], an iOS app that uses AR and realtime face tracking to make it look like your face is pushed out from behind the wall. 

After shipping *In The Walls*, I decided to return to my original interest: music visualization. Believe it or not, the AR part was actually the easy part of development; I spent far more time trying to figure out and debug various audio APIs. Along the way, I also discovered that [DRM was alive and well](/the-war-we-forgot), much to Beatsy's detriment.

DRM aside, I'm really happy with how Beatsy turned out. Music has always shaped my experience of the world. Beatsy brings that feeling to life. I still find it cool to load up different songs in the app and try placing visualizers on different surfaces. Below for example, I placed a huge visualizer out in Puget Sound during sunset, making it look like the entire surface of the water was distorting to the music.

Definitely [give Beatsy a try][app] and let me know if you have any feedback. Stay tuned for future updates too!
