What is the role of the camera? What draws us to the lens? Does a photograph capture the objective or only present the illusion of objectivity?

This video profiles an artist whose work explores these highly relevant questions and asks us to reappraise photography. Through his often shockingly candid work, the artist reveals that not only is photography a capitalistic act of voyeuristic appropriation as posited by Sontag, but that photography itself inherently reflects and reinforces an odious phallocentric viewpoint. In this framework, the modern celebration of photography and proliferation of image based culture can only be explained as primal drive to see as, claim, and eventually even become the phallus.
