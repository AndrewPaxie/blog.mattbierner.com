*Gif Shift* is [another gif web app](/series/gif), this time about editing gifs using tools that shift pixels forward or backwards in time.

*Gif Shift* lets you edit gifs using a paintbrush that doesn't change pixel data, but instead changes which frame in the gif that pixel samples from. Imagine the brush as either pulling the painted pixels forward in time so that they sample from future frames, or pushing them backwards so that they sample from past frames. You can use this to create still images that sample from multiple frames of a gif or to create new animated gifs.

In many ways, *Gif Shift* is a freeform version of [Scanline.gif](/scanline-gif). (Also, as you may guess from the site's layout, *Gif Shift* was built on top of [Gif Mask](/gif-mask)). However while working on *Gif Shift*, I quickly discovered that—although the idea is certainly neat—creating good looking results is not easy! The more programmatic approach from *Scanline* is far easier to work with.

Still, it can be fun to mess around and I do like the idea of editing tools that manipulate time.
