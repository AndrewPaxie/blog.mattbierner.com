Another letterpress *Aerobicide* print. This one was printed in six passes on a Chandler & Price platen press. The stem and apple body were laser cut linoleum, with the apple then carved down for a four pass reduction cut to give it more depth. It was finished off with a bit of metal type. This print was for a class project themed around the word "origin", so just having a dripping apple without anything in the ways of explanatory text was a bit vague.

The apple and the text inside it are in reference to the song *Only You Tonight* by Donna De Lory. It is truly a travesty that this work has never been made more widely available, although the lo-fi, VHS quality of currently available editions does somewhat add to its charm.
