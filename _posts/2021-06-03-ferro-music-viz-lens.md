I just published my first Snapchat lens: [Ferro Music Viz][lens]. This recreates a version of [Beatsy's][beatsy] 'Ferro' music visualizer for Snapchat.

The most popular feature request I hear for [Beatsy][beatsy] is Android support. While I unfortunately don't have the time (or skill) to develop a full Android AR app, Snapchat's [Lens Studio](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com) let me build a cross-platform AR experience that works pretty well. The other key benefit is that shipping as a Lens means my world distorting music visualizing effects can be accessed right from an existing social media app.

This first lens is mostly to test the waters. If there's a good reception, I may try port over a few other Beatsy effects. While the main Beatsy app will always offer the best AR music visualization experience, hopefully this Lens lets more people get a taste of world distorting AR music visualizers.

[So give the new lens a try][lens]. If you like it, be sure to share it too. As always, [let me know](https://twitter.com/mattbierner) if you have any suggestions or feedback.
