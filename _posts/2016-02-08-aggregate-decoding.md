[@Arthur_Morty][Arthur_Morty] is a Twitter account that posts a random image from [Wikimedia Commons][commons], plus a random sampling of between one and three hashtags every 10 minutes.

{% include image.html file="hero.png" %}

Besides dabeling in postmodernist social commentary, Mr. Morty is quite the infrastructure photography enthusiast, and has been known to indulge in some truly cringeworthy wordplay (characteristic not dissimilar to yours truly).

Unlike [@_LovedHArt][_LovedHArt], this project does not maintain long term memory. @Arthur_Morty lives in the now, constantly sampling tweets for trending tags. He may also post about the same hashtag more than once (and god damn does he want to win that #EsuranceSweepstakes).

Source code and instructions for running are [available on Github][src].
