I call it the iMask.

It's an old iMac case with a black mask painted on the screen. Pretty dated wordplay, I know.

{% include image.html file="title.jpg" %}

I painted the iMask by sitting in a pool of paint and then sitting on the screen. That last sentence sort of changes how you see the design, doesn't it?

Well actually, the iMask started as me trying to paint on the screen using my face. Faces however are a lot more three dimensional and a lot less squishy than I expected. I even tried rolling my face across the glass hoping it would create a Rorschach type pattern. No such luck. Damn nose.

<!-- I will say that making it was not as easy it may sound. Also, I kept picturing myself winning a Darwin Award if the glass shattered... -->

So instead, iMask! I consider it to be a valuable contribution to internet discourse. Whoa, so meta.
