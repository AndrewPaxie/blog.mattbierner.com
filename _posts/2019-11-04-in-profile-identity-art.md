What is relationship between art and artist? Is it possible understand one without the other? Does it matter who created a given piece of artwork?

Today's *In Profile* joins an artist who understands art to be an expression and a reflection of identity. Their highly topical body of work is an assertion that artists can only speak authentically and honestly by quite literally putting themselves in to their work, and only then is it worth listening to what they are saying. In this view, we owe it to artists to see them not as individuals, but as the identities they present to us.
