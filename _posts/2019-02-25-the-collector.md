It seems that just about every day the media breathlessly reports on a new record breaking auction for classical or contemporary art. For most however, the high-end art market remains shrouded in mystery. How does one value the invaluable? What motivates collectors to spend fortunes on these artworks, and how did they develop such keen expertise, profound appreciation, and refined tastes? What is the importance of the high-end art market in the trajectory of a great work?

In today's *In Profile*, we join a prominent collector to discuss art and the art market, and also join him for a very special private show featuring two of his favorite acquisitions (conservatively valued in the low nine figures).

(Don't yellow Rothko though; he never deserved what's happened to his art)
