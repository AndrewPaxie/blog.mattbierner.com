description: 'A Screenplay'
---

I wrote [a screenplay][pdf] inspired by the current COVID situation. It's about as subtle as an atom bomb yet also captures a little of how I've felt during the lockdown: that sense of isolation despite being connected, those inevitable miscommunications, the physical longing. There's also sex, scissor fetishes, freudian linguistic shenanigans, and (spoiler alert) death. Fun times!

This is my first attempt at putting together a screenplay and it was certainly a good learning exercise. Even if it weren't for COVID though, turning this into a short film seems well beyond my capability. Maybe one day.

Anyways, here's the PDF for [*Encounters: Separation*][pdf]
