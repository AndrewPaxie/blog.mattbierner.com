You can think of warpAR as [Photoshop's liquify effect](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/liquify-filter.html), but for the real world. The app includes 6 different adjustable distortion tools. 

Try using distorting different surfaces and seeing what you can create. I personally find it oddly satisfying to mess up a wall and then fix it back up with the healing tool. You can also easily capture photos and videos of your creations to share.

So give warpAR a try. It's free and offers some fun creative options. If you like the app be sure to tell some friends and leave a review too. That really helps people discover the app.
