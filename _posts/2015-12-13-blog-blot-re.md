The new Blot're company blog is [up and running](http://blog.blot.re). There's even a timely [new post](http://blog.blot.re/we-are-the-rainbow/) about a new business opportunity that Blot're is pursuing. One section is titled: "Terrorists are the New Millennials". Good stuff.

The Blot're posts never quite fit with the rest of this blog, not that there has ever been any real theme to begin with. Hopefully, this will make it more clear when I'm writing something about Blot're, vs writing something as Blot're. Porting over the posts also gave me a chance to fix some of the most egregious spelling and grammar errors (*through* vs *though* vs *thought* seems to be particularly problematic.)
