*Gif Mask* is a simple web app about remixing gifs using [image masks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing)#Image_masks).

This app continues [my exploration of remixing gifs and viewing them in new ways](/series/gif). With *Gif Mask*, I wanted to explore playing back multiple gifs at the same time, but have it so that different portions of each gif would be visible. Because, really, all these damn gifs are happening at the same time, aren't they?

The app lets users explore this concept. It is not meant to provide a Photoshop style editing experience for authoring new gifs, but instead let you play around and quickly remix gifs.

The app is entirely client side. No user data is stored or uploaded. So yes, all those shirtless Tom Selleck gifs will stay between you and your screen.
