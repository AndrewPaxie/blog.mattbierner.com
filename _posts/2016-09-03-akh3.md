Akh so! Akh 3 is out now.

```js
$ npm install --save akh
```

Akh is a Javascript collection of monads and [monad transformers](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Monad_transformers) inspired by [MTL][mtl]. Version three brings some new types to the party, breaks the collection up into a set of proper npm packages, and gives the API a quick dusting. Let's take a quick look at the key changes.


# Cleaner API
Back in the bad old Akh 2 days, you had to write imports like this:

```js
// Akh 2
const EitherT = require('akh').trans.either
```

Akh 3 simplifies imports and namespaces so that you now write:

```js
// Akh 3 
const EitherT = require('akh').EitherT
// or even
import {EitherT} from 'akh'
```

The old `require('akh').base` helper functions have also now all been moved to top level exports:

```js
// Akh 2
const liftM = require('akh').base.liftM

// Akh 3
const liftM = require('akh').liftM
```

Also, the names of the various run/extract methods have been simplified and you can now even use them as methods:

```js
// Akh 2
const List = require('akh').type.list
List.runList(List.of(2))

// Akh 3
const List = require('akh').List
List.run(List.of(2))
// or even
List.of(2).run()
```


# Packages for Everything
The core [`akh` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/akh) still wraps up all your favorite types, such `Either` and `Cont`, but you can now also consume those types through individual npm packages:

```js
// Use Either as part of main Akh library
const Either = require('akh').Either

// Only import just the Either type
const Either = require('akh.either').Either
```

This allows specifying lighter-weight, more targeted dependencies. It should also make it easier to maintain and iterate on the core type implementations (he says optimistically), and make it easier to extend Akh.

Here's the list of official types and their packages, as of version 3.1:

* [akh.cont](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-cont) – Continuations
* [akh.dcont](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-dcont) – Delimited continuations
* [akh.either](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-either) – Either
* [akh.error](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-error) – Error
* [akh.identity](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-identity) – Identity
* [akh.list](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-list) – List
* [akh.maybe](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-maybe) – Maybe
* [akh.reader](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-reader) – Reader
* [akh.state](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-state) – State
* [akh.unique](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-unique) – Unique
* [akh.writer](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-writer) – Writer


# Maybe, Reader, and Writer
Akh 3.1 brings friends `Reader`, `Writer`, and `Maybe` into the core collection, along with their transformer progenitors `ReaderT`, `WriterT`, and `MaybeT`.

`Maybe` and `MaybeT` from [akh.maybe](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-maybe) should be familiar enough. `MaybeT` extends an underlying value to support optional values while `Maybe` brings this logic on its own. Here's a classic example:


```js
const Maybe = require('akh').Maybe

const safeDiv = (x, y) =>
    y === 0 ? Maybe.nothing : Maybe.just(x / y)

Maybe.just(3)
    .chain(x => safeDiv(12, x))
    .map(x => x * x)
    .maybe('default') === 16  // extract value or return 'default' if none
    
Maybe.just(0)
    .chain(x => safeDiv(12, x))
    .maybe('default') === 'default'
```

`Reader` and `ReaderT` from [akh.reader](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-reader) allow reading from a shared environment:

```js
const Reader = require('akh').Reader

Reader.asks(r => r.a)
    .map(x => x * 2),
    .run({ a: 10, b: 3 }) === 20
```

`Writer` and `Writer` from [akh.write](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh-writer) allow producing a value along with a list of output values:

```js
const Writer = require('akh').Writer
const List = require('akh').List;

const r = Writer.tell(List.of(1)) // append to output
    .censor(x => x.concat(List.of(5))) // modify output
    .map(_ => 'result')
    .run(List.zero)

r.value === 'result'
r.output.run() == [1, 5] // Extract array from the List using `run()`
```


# Issues / Feedback
So if you wish your Javascript had some monad transformers, give Akh a try. (Admittedly, that target market may be close to one, but oh well.)  

[Please let me know if you run into any problems, have any suggestions, or would like to contribute to Akh's development](https://github.com/mattbierner/akh/issues). I've also tried to clean up the documentation to make it easier to get started.
