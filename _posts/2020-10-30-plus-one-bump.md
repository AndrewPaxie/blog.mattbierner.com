Halloween is very nearly upon us and you know what that means! That's right, it's time to break out everyone's favorite song about a fright that's always lurking in the shadows... It's time of course to do *The Plus One Bump*!

<h2>The Plus One Bump</h2>

<i>(sung to the tune of the Monster Mash)</i>

<br>
<br>

<p>
I was working in my codebase late one night<br>
When my eyes beheld a disturbing sight<br>
For a ping came in, breaking my flow<br>
'Twas a little something you already know...
</p>
<p>
It was a bump, a plus one bump<br>
A plus one bump, it was a thoughtless dump<br>
It was a bump, it gave maintainers grumps<br>
It was a bump, a plus one bump
</p>
<p>
From the starless repos of open source<br>
To big huge projects corpos endorse<br>
The commenters flowed in with spirit and cheer<br>
Asking me "Hey what's the status here?"
</p>
<p>
They did the bump, the plus one bump<br>
The plus one bump, it was a thoughtless dump<br>
They did the bump, it gave maintainers grumps<br>
They did the bump, the plus one bump
</p>
<p>
A rando kicked it off<br>
Then some trolls began to scoff<br>
Soon we were joined by a ghost<br>
And some guy named Karloff
</p>
<p>
The thread was rockin', all were chiming in<br>
On other issues too, it was quite a din<br>
Yet through it all, I could not find<br>
A single PR, to get behind
</p>
<p>
No they sent a bump, they sent a plus one bump<br>
A plus one bump, it was a thoughtless dump<br>
They sent a bump, it gave maintainers grumps<br>
They sent a bump, they sent a plus one bump
</p>
<p>
The bumping got fancy, it was quite the show<br>
Asking "What's taking so long?" we just want to know<br>
Some got snarky, but most were sincere <br>
Because it's fun, playing program manage-ier
</p>
<p>
And it's a new bump, it's a new plus one bump<br>
A new plus one bump, and a new thoughtless dump<br>
It's a new bump, it gave maintainers grumps<br>
And It's a new bump, it's a new plus one bump
</p>
<p>
I'm not a mean guy, I hope you understand<br>
It's just that plus one comments, should be banned<br>
For if this issue, matters so much to you<br>
Then why not help out, with a PR or two!
</p>
<p>
And then you can bump, then you can version bump<br>
A version bump, and a new code dump<br>
Then you can bump, and your heart will thump<br>
Then you can bump, then you can version bump!
</p>

<p>
<i>Wah-ooh, aahh,</i> Version bump! <i>Wah-ooh, aahhh</i>, Version bump!<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Codi</b>: Argh, plus one bad! PR good!!<br>
<b>Singer</b>: Easy there Codi, you imperious young lad.<br>
<b>Codi</b>: Argh, PR good! PR GOOD!!!

So, there it is.

I briefly investigated hiring someone to record the *Plus One Bump*, but wasn't sure where to find a singer who could impersonate someone impersonating Boris Karloff. <!-- plus Spelunky 2... --> But hey, if you've feeling up for recording an extremely nerdy take on an already pretty square song, give it a shot. Someone really should put together some appropriate dance moves too...

And remember kids: don't be a plus one bumper! If you see any plus one bumping going on, send the party over this way so that they can learn, just like Codi did, that: plus one bad! PR good! PR GOOD!!!
