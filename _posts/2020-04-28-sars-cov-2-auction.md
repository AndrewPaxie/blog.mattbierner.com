That's the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome on [punched tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_tape).

I'm auctioning off a roll of it [here][auction]. All proceeds go to [Direct Relief](https://www.directrelief.org) which is currently providing COVID-19 relief. Bidding obviously starts at $19.99, and better get in quick "'cuz like they say, oops out of time."

Also: free shipping!

The genome was printed using the same paper tape machine and encoding that I used for [my attempt to print the human genome](/dna-print). Compared the human genome though, SARS-CoV-2 is a sneaky little bastard with only [30,000 bases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512). Even with a very inefficient encoding that punches one base per line, the tape is only around 250 feet long (75 meters) stretched out and 5 inches (12 cm) in diameter when rolled up. <!-- the roll is roughly one million times larger than an actual virus! -->

So yeah, finally you can get yourself COVID-19 over the internet! Stick it in an airtight display case. Shower it in Lysol. Burn it. Whatever. It's for a good cause.
