They say that everyone's a critic, but while it's easy to criticize, few have the unique combination of abilities required to be a true critic. To appreciate this fact, for today's *In Profile*, we join a renowned art critic for a very special criticism of Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi. This is a rare treat as the old master almost never grants criticism.

As you watch, note how the critic's nuanced observations and eloquent elucidations enlighten while also cutting through the pretensions often associated with classical art criticism. The casual viewer will undoubtably walk away with not only a new appreciation of the art and its context, but also of the critical importance of art criticism in holding both art—and society more broadly—to the highest of standards.
